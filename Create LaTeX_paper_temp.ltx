Life is an intricate tapestry woven with the threads of time, an ever-\smallskip unfolding narrative of experiences and emotions.
\bigskip It begins with the first breath, a moment of inception that propels us into a world brimming with possibilities. Childhood dances with the pure joy of discovery, innocence guiding our steps through a landscape of wonder. The journey through adulthood navigates the ebbs and flows of responsibility, love, and ambition, a complex mosaic of relationships and aspirations. 
\section{Methods}
for this thesis, i made the using formula
\begin{equation}
    a = b + c
    \label{eqSum}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    F = \sqrt[n]{G \times\frac{m_1 \times m_2}{d^2}}
    \label{eqNewton}
\end{equation}

starting from equation \ref{eqSum} ecc, ecc
As we have seen in equation \ref{eqNewton}, ecc ecc ecc
as we saw to section \ref{secIntro} ecc ecc
\section{Results}
ecc ecc
